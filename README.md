# Lossy-Text-Compression
This is my old project from around 2011, that started with a simple question: Can you write an 8 letter word with 7 letters? The answer is "Yes, kinda, but why on Earth would you?"

It's a very silly project, that strips nearly all symbols from input and makes everything lowercase, then uses those extra stripped symbols and uppercase/lowercase symbols to represent in the input, effectively squeezing an extra bit of information from each.

There's not really much use to this, other than just making something silly/esoteric and playing with code, but I hope you enjoy it regardless!
